Realtek's rtl8188C_8192C_usb_linux drivers for RTL8192CU (v3.4.3_4369.20120622)

The main purpose of this repository is to build the RTL8192CU drivers for
the Raspberry Pi.

It's set-up assuming you're doing a cross-compile on an Ubuntu/Linux box,
rather than compiling on the RPi itself.  It assumes you already have the
arm-linux-gnueabi package installed (and that you have the kernel source).


================================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

cd rtl8192cu (or whatever you call the source directory)
make
sudo make install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/media/[PATH_TO_MOUNTED_RPI_ROOT]


================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

It's set-up to build from a Linux kernel installed at ${PWD}/../linux

If you have the kernel somewhere else, supply that location with KSRC
  For instance: make KSRC=/lib/modules/kernel/build

It's set-up to install based on my experimental kernel: 3.2.21-nectarine-rpi

If you want to install using a different kernel, supply that version with KVER
  For instance: sudo make install KVER=3.2.21 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/media/[PATH]

Kernels and drivers are not my usual space so if you have suggestions, feel
free to make them; if you have questions, I'll do my best to answer...
