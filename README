Realtek's rtl8188C_8192C_usb_linux drivers for RTL8192CU (v3.4.3_4369.20120622)

The main purpose of this repository is to build the RTL8192CU drivers for
the Raspberry Pi.

It's set-up assuming you're doing a cross-compile on an Ubuntu/Linux box,
rather than compiling on the RPi itself.  It assumes you already have the
arm-linux-gnueabi package installed.


================================================================================
PREPARATION (Optional)
================================================================================

Out of the box, this is set up to build against my experimental kernel (which is
really just a clone of bootc's RPi kernel work).  If you want to use this kernel
you'll need to follow these instructions.  Ignore these steps if you want to use
your own kernel sources.  First, mount your RPi SDHC card on your Ubuntu box...

Next, update your RPi's firmware:

  git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/ rpi-firmware
  cd rpi-firmware/boot
  sudo cp arm128_start.elf arm192_start.elf arm224_start.elf bootcode.bin \
    loader.bin start.elf /media/[SD_BOOT]/
  cd ../..

Then, check out the kernel:

  git clone https://github.com/ksclarke/linux.git
  cd linux
  git checkout -b rpi-3.2.21-nectarine
  make mrproper
  cp arch/arm/configs/nectarine_defconfig .config
  make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi- silentoldconfig

Check how many processors you have:

  cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l

Use that info for the compiler ("-j 6" for quad core; "-j 3" for dual core):

  make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi- -k -j 6

Copy the results to the mounted RPi partitions:

  sudo cp linux/arch/arm/boot/Image /media/[SD_BOOT]/kernel.img
  sudo make ARCH=arm modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/media/[SD_ROOT]

Then, you're good to build the RTL8192CU wireless USB drivers and install them.


================================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

git clone https://github.com/ksclarke/rtl8192cu.git
cd rtl8192cu
make
sudo make install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/media/[SD_ROOT]


================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

It's set-up to build from a Linux kernel installed at ${PWD}/../linux

If you have the kernel somewhere else, supply that location with KSRC
  For instance: make KSRC=/lib/modules/kernel/build

It's set-up to install based on my experimental kernel: 3.2.21-nectarine-rpi

If you want to install using a different kernel, supply that version with KVER
  For instance: sudo make install KVER=3.2.21 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/media/[SD_ROOT]

Kernels and drivers are not my usual space so if you have suggestions, feel
free to make them; if you have questions, I'll do my best to answer...
